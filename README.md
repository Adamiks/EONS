#Tech Tree
As you may or may not know, I lost all access to the LucidChart editing right because I ran out of a free trial and my document overloaded the amount of objects a oducment could have. So, I will post a dumbed-own version of the tech tree here.

##Stone Age
Fire --> Torches --\
                    --------------> Fire Arrows (Cable Backed Bow)
Weapons --> Advanced Weapons --/
        \--> Weapon Creation --> Advanced Weapon Creation
          \--> Wooden Armour
          
Tailoring --> Cloth Walls
Masonry -------/--> Stone Furniture
            \--> Basic Cover

Dirt Roads --> Basic Mechanics --> Water Mill

##Bronze Age
(Advanced Weps.) --> Bronze Weapons --> Bronze Armour
                  /--> Bronze Limbs
Bronze Working --/

(I'll finish this later, I just realized that I have to integrate a few more eras because of the poll that just finished today.)
